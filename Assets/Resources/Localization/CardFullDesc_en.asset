    m_Localized: Sometimes everyone needs a drink, well, I wanted to drink a couple
      of drops today. Well, yes, I ended up on the other side of the world, so what?

    m_Localized: Are you also going to some unknown poor peasant on the edge of the
      earth? This guy is exactly what a good fellow, I hope I say goodbye to him
      today.

    m_Localized: An arrow that somehow ended up in my knee. Why can't I remember

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 230210129920
    m_Localized: They are vile, disgusting. They have nothing human, they are not
      people, they are already demons, but what I do to them, I will have to give
      what they demand.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 277261832192
    m_Localized: Sometimes it can get into the eyes, something that cannot even be

    m_Localized: "\rHow cute is he. I wonder where he comes from, the main thing

  - m_Id: 387030962176
    m_Localized: How much did you think about your speech? Do you choose words effectively
      in the current situation, are they acceptable? Before going to bed, I always
      train my larynx. I am sure today I will give a sharper result in the store.

    m_Localized: "\rA bright flash followed by an equally bright explosion. Lightning
      could break my house, but not my spirit, I will put out the fire and patch
      up the hole."

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 505260003328
    m_Localized: How nice that someone wrote to me. I hope it's not the IRS.

    m_Localized: "\rThere is land, it is uneven. There is water, it flows. Surprisingly,
      if you mix them. Some of them will turn out to be mud, but the earth is not
      able to absorb water to the end and this appears ..."

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 614995578880
    m_Localized: To be honest, I like rain more than sunny weather. The sun mercilessly
      bakes constantly, and the rain indulgently hits with drops of water. And it's
      more atmospheric. Although it has some side effects...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 661539770368
    m_Localized: Little or not. There is only one essence, a freeloader rodent, unable
      to help in any way, only eats and runs away from me, how annoying.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 708117516288
    m_Localized: Sometimes people come into our lives whom we did not call, that's
      okay. But if they still take our things, it's terrible.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 765344600064
    m_Localized: "\rPeople, especially the rich, throw away their money, they have
      so much metal in their pockets that they sometimes fall out of their pockets."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 835272036352
    m_Localized: War... The rulers are fighting for a piece of land that will give
      them an advantage in the next battle or trade, this is an inevitable event,
      because a person always wants more and more.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 872563593216
    m_Localized: A dangerous beast, without a weapon, I have to give up all my food

    m_Localized: The plague is the danger. There is nothing worse than the plague.
      The medicine is insanely expensive, and at the slightest delay they will get

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6060160256036864
    m_Localized: Because of the war, the warriors have nothing to eat and they decided
      that the hunger of one person cannot be compared with the defeat in the following
      battles, it sounds logical, but why is it so offensive to me.

    m_Localized: 'Sometimes soldiers need something that can help win the next battle,
